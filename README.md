# FilmQueryProject

# Description
This application allows for the user to access a database that holds information for 1,000 films. Such information includes the title of the film, release year, age appropriate rating, a brief description, language spoken, and the main actors in the film. The user is able to access the information for a specific film by entering the identification number for that film. The user also has the option of searching for keywords that are found in the title or description of that film. 

Upon starting the program, the user is taken to a main menu. The menu contains three options, labeled numerically, in which the user may interact with.
The instructions for navigating through the menu are listed below.

SELECTING OPTION 1:
This function allows for the user to search through the database for a film based off its unique identification number. Once selected, the user is prompted to enter the identification number of the film they are interested in. After the user makes their entry, the program will retrieve the details of the film associated with the entered identification number. 

SELECTING OPTION 2:
This function allows for the user to enter a keyword they wish to search. This search option will retrieve the information of the film(s) that match the user's keyword. Once this option is selected, the user is prompted to enter their desired keyword and press enter. If a film's title or description contains the keyword, the program will display the information of all the films that contain a match.

SELECTING OPTION 3:
Selecting this option allows the user to exit the application.
